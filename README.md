# StackTest
A C# console application that creates a stack using a stack class and returns the values to the user in LIFO fashion.
The stack class uses "boxing" to convert a value type to a reference type so it is stored in the heap instead of the stack.
The heap is used to store objects that will require a longer lifetime.
